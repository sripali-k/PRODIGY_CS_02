# Prodigy_CS_02 - Internship Project

## Overview
This repository contains my internship project for the Prodigy_CS_02 program. The project focuses on implementing image encryption and decryption algorithms using Python. The aim is to develop a tool that securely encrypts images and allows for decryption using the same method.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- Pillow (PIL)
- NumPy (if applicable)

## Features
- **Image Encryption**: Encrypts images using a specified algorithm.
- **Image Decryption**: Decrypts images back to their original form.
- Supports various image formats.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sripali-k/prodigy_cs_02.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
   cd prodigy_cs_02
3. Install required packages:
    ```bash
   pip install pillow numpy

### Usage
1. Place your input images in the input-image folder.
2. Run the encryption script:
   ```bash
   python image_encryption.py
3. Check the output-image folder for the encrypted images.

## Key Changes
1. **Code Block Formatting**: Added closing backticks for the **Project Structure** section to properly format the code block.
2. **Bullet Points**: Adjusted the bullets in the **Installation** section to ensure each step is correctly delineated and clearly defined.
3. **Consistent Markdown Syntax**: Used backticks consistently around folder and file names (like `input-image` and `output-image`) in the **Usage** section for clarity.
4. **General Formatting**: Ensured proper indentation and spacing for improved readability.

## Final Notes
- **URL Placeholder**: Make sure to replace `https://github.com/sripali-k/prodigy_cs_02.git` with the actual URL of your GitHub repository.
- **Review Technologies**: Double-check that the listed technologies (like NumPy) are relevant to your project; if not used, you might want to omit them.
